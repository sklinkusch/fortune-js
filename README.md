# fortune-js

A fortune teller game in four languages (English, French, German, Latin) on a website, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Answers are completely random. There is no warranty, that you will like the fortune. If you don't like an answer, press the yellow button. Then, you will get a new fortune. Changing languages can be done using the dropdown menu; if you then press the yellow button, the next fortune will be in the desired language.

There is also no warranty, that the fortune will come true. 😁

The website is available [here](https://sklinkusch.github.io/fortune-js).
